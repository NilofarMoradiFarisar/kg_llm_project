# KG_LLM_project-NLP
The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) has emerged as a promising approach to enhance the representation of structured knowledge. This term paper explores the use of LLMs to augment KGs by encoding textual descriptions of entities and relations, enriching their embeddings with semantic context. Conventional KGE methods often struggle with unseen entities and long-tail relations due to their reliance on structural information alone. To address this, recent research has incorporated LLMs as text encoders and in joint text-KG embedding models, demonstrating improvements in various tasks such as knowledge graph completion, reasoning, and recommendation. Methods like Pretrain-KGE and KEPLER combine LLM-based textual encoding with graph structure learning, achieving significant gains in embedding quality. The results suggest that LLM-augmented KGEs have potential to expand knowledge graph capabilities, but challenges like handling incomplete knowledge and optimizing fusion techniques remain. Future research should focus on refining joint training approaches, exploring multimodal knowledge integration, and improving the interpretability of synergized LLM-KG systems.
